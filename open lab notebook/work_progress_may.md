## Monday
- free

## Tuesday
- lab meeting
- translated the questionnaire into english again (corrected some things)
- checked questionnaires and put them into json files
- to do: discuss with Mirjam and Marie about Music Feature Extraction --> come to a conclusion!!

## Wednesday
- to do: discuss with Mirjam, Michael and Marie about the analysis of the questionnaire
conclusions: we were not sure if we want to calculate the absolute frequency or do some weighted frequencies
therefore, we wanted to talk to Herr Lemmer about that problem
- searched for new people who completed our questionnaire
--> wrote the output of those people into a json file
--> documented the name of the json file in a spreadsheet
- began to convert the json file in a csv file 
- did some corrections on the function for converting json files into csv files
--> created a sheet for errors: where the error of one subject is precisely defined as "XY is missing" or "XY is not complete"
this is done by a 'if, else command'

## Thursday
- reading of "A multi level tonal interval space for modelling pitch relatedness and musical consonance" by Gilberto Bernardes, Diogo Cocharro, Marcelo Caetano, Carlos Guedes & Matthew E.P. Davies (2016)

## Friday
- talked to Herr Lemmer about the analysis of the questionnaire: documented solutions in a file and sent it to group
- searched for new people who completed our questionnaire
--> wrote them into json files
- did some corrections on the function for converting json files into csv files because there was always the error "missing values for chills often" for every subject
--> 'auschließlich' to 'ausschliesslich'
- wrote the for loop so that the loop will go through every file in my order where the json files are and convert them into csv files
- to do: Essentia --> audio analysis
        look at Michaels proposals for analysing questionnaire
