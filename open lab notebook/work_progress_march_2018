to do's: Datenmanagementplan, Registered Report, OSF: Präregistrierung
Monday: reading about pitch in "The Oxford Handbook of Music Psychology" and http://auditoryneuroscience.com/pitch
Tuesday: started with preregistration report, stopped at analysis part, how will the analysis look like? searched for
basic explanations about bayesian modeling in the internet (e.g. what is the prior in bayesian statistics?) started to read
the introduction of "Pattern Component Modelling" by Diedrichsen et al.
Wednesday: continue readings on "Pattern Component Modelling" by Diedrichsen et al.
Thursday: searched for sequences in planet earth videos without violence, sex etc.
Friday: read the paper of Yokoi et al. about "The Role of Human Primary Motor Cortex in the Production of Skilled Finger Movements"
to get a better understanding of Pattern Component Modelling
--> pattern component modeling as an analysis for comparing RDMs
--> log bayesian factor as a factor that evaluates the fitting of a model

to do's: Datenmanagementplan, Registered Report, OSF: Präregistrierung
Monday: started to read about Music Information Retrieval "An Evaluation of Audio Feature Extraction Toolboxes" by Moffat et al.
- Essentia is the music feature extraction toolbox Mirjam, Marie & I first discussed about, tried to install that --> failed
- discussed with Peer about using Bregman Toolbox: meeting for music information retrieval on tuesday at 8:30
Tuesday: 
- installing Bregman Toolkit failed because "suite" couldn't be found.
- Peer showed to Marie and me how the code for music feature extraction looks like and what is done with it
- to do's: read about music feature extraction
- continue with data managementplan 
Wednesday: 
- news: validation survey can b uploaded soon: my work: translating it into english
- continued to work on data managment plan
Thursday:

- skyped with Peer, Mirjam & Marie --> talked about music feature extraction
to do's until 11.04.2018: install Essentia; get to know how feature extraction works; try distance calculation in Bregman
-brought 10 music samples of one subgenre into one piece of music with Audacity
