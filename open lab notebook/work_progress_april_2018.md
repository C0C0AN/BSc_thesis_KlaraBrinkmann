# 02.04.2018 - 06.04.2018
## Pause

# 09.04.2018 - 13.04.2018
## Monday
- translated the validation survey from German into English
- checked questionnaire for validation survey in spyder for "null" for sortable items
- checked questionnaire for validation survey in spyder for values

## Tuesday
- installed essentia
- read about the algorithms in essentia

## Wednesday
- tried to run essentia in python --> failed
- trying to figure out why

## Thursday
- checked validation survey script for typos and umlauts

## Friday
- clicked through validation survey
- Bregman toolkit worked after putting the bregman toolkit in the right path (python2.7 environment instead of python 3.6 environment)

# 16.04.2018 - 20.04.2018
## Monday
- went through Python tutorial for Essentia

## Tuesday
- AG-Meeting
- correction on baroque nd rock'n'roll music stimuli for validation survey
- to do's: distance calculation in essentia
- inform myself about feature extraction
- http://ismir2000.ismir.net/papers/logan_paper.pdf --> read this paper to understand MFCC

## Wednesday
- tried to do FFT algorithm in Essentia
- started with Python tutorials


# 23.04.2018 - 27.04.2018

## Monday
- updated the english validation survey of the music stimuli
- Python Tutorials: until args and kwargs parameters
- to do's for this week: 
    - continue with python tutorials
    - generate IDs and send them to people
    - think about models for musicians and non-musicians
    - solve distance calculation in Essentia!!!

## Tuesday
- Python Tutorials: classes, modules and exceptions

## Friday
- sended validation questionnaire to people

## Sunday
- worked on introduction part for thesis

# 30.04.2018 - 04.05.2018

## Monday
- corrigated String for validation survey
- distance calculation in essentia is possible but the output is different to Bregman

## Wednesday
- to do: distance calculation in essentia
- discovered article about music feature extraction http://ismir2010.ismir.net/proceedings/ismir2010-107.pdf
- prepared presentation for brainhack on friday about music feature extraction

## Thursday
- prepared presentation for brainhack on friday about music feature extraction

## Friday
- brainhack: presentation about music feature extraction
    --> remaining questions: why do we have to connect algorithms in Essentia?
    --> shift operator in Essentia means something else than stated in Python tutorials
- euclidean distance calculation can also be done with scikitlearn
- euclidean distance of bregman is normed --> this results in different values of different programs, but euclidean distance should be the same, bregman doesn't explain how they "normed" their values, it is just stated that they normed their values

## Saturday
- drawed models for musicians and non-musicians on paper
--> open question: which values should we assume for models? Is there any study we can orientate on?
- discovered Journal of New Music Research: downloaded some articles about music feature extraction
to do: read those articles about music feature extraction

## Sunday
- reading
