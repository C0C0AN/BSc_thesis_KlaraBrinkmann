Data management plan

1. project description

Goals:
 The goal of this study is to compare the explicit representation of music genres between musicians and non-musicians. 
Furthermore music feature models will be compared to the models of the participants (e.g. did they 
arrange the musical stimuli according to timbre, pitch, tempo, rhythm, harmony etc.?).

 Therefore 15 musicians and 15 non-musicians shall be assessed to evaluate 20 samples of music 
without vocals with a duration of 6 seconds coming from 4 different main genres (rock, classic, african-american, electro). 

 Evaluation of these music samples will take place in front of a computer by the use of inverse multidimensional scaling
as described by Kriegeskorte & Mur in 2012. After the inverse multidimensional scaling the participants will fill out 
two questionnaires concerning music preferences (MPQ-R (Nater et al. 2015) & STOMP (Rentfrow & Gosling 2003)) and 
two tests to determine their musical understanding (MBEA (Peretz et al. 2003), MET (Wallentin et al. 2010)).

 The comparison of the representational similarity matrices shall be done by Pattern Component Modeling as stated 
by Diedrichsen et al. in 2017.
- general comparison of the matrices between musicians and non-musicians
- comparison of the musicians’ matrices with the music feature matrices
- comparison of the non-musicians’ matrices with the music feature matrices

Promoter: 
 Peer Herholz is leading the project. Klara Brinkmann is writing her bachelor thesis about music genre similarity.

- reports on the costs and the personnel expenditure for maintaining the data management plan
- running costs for data curation, production of metadata, archiving etc.
Data management is observed by Klara Brinkmann as part of her bachelor thesis.
