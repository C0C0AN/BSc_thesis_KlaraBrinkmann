08.01. - 15.01.2018
- reading the method paper ("inverse multidimensional scaling" of Kriegeskorte & Mur (2008))
- preparing a short presentation of the method for the work group about inverse multidimensional scaling
- open questions for the method:
  how does that algorithm "lifting of the weakest" work?
  what does the algorithm estimate after each trial?

15.01. - 22.01.2018
- talking with Peer about demographic data that should be asked in questionnaires after the rating
- task: search for papers/questionnaires for "music demography"
        prepare short presentation about algorithm "lifting the weakest"
        prepare a structure for my thesis
- reading wikipedia article about "Musikalische Sozialisation" (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musikalische_Sozialisation)

22.01. - 29.01.2018
- open science talk in library of Universität Marburg
- reading the abstract of "A Combined Model of Sensory and Cognitive Representations Underlying Tonal Expectations in Music: 
From Audio Signals to Behavior" (Tom Collins, Barbara Tillmann, Frederick S. Barrett, Charles Delbé, Petr Janata)
- thinking about structure of my thesis 
- writing structure of my thesis down
- converting stimuli from .wav into .mp3
- discussing with mirjam about loudness of stimuli: they are not equally loud although they were normalized
 --> is there a normalization tool in audacity that can make them equally loud?
 --> we don't know yet which stimuli we will have in our final study design because valdiation study is still in progress

29.01. - 05.02.2018
- preparing presentation for bachelor thesis in work group
- talked with mirjam about normalization: normalization in audacity can make stimuli equally loud
- to do's for the next week:
    editing my presentation about bachelor thesis: 
      changing the point that musicians chose the music genre they play
      changing in results the point that there are models for musicians and models for non-musicians
      upload the presentation in Google Drive
      continue with writing introduction
