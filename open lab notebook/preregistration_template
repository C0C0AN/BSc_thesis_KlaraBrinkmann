1) What is the main question being addressed in your study?
	Why is it important that we answer this question? What’s the big picture?
- How does the explicit judgment about music genres differ between musicians and non-musicians?
- If the answer is yes it means that specific musical training & musical learning can drives perception.
- If the answer is no it means that there were probably some methodological issues biasing the results.
- If the answer is no it can also mean that musical training can’t drive perception.

2) Describe the key independent and dependent variable(s), specifying how they will be measured.
	- Independent Variable: Musician or non-musician
				Categorization for a musician: Minimum of 10 years of musical
        training, currently practicing more than 1 hour/ week,
				 musical training = playing an instrument or singing in a choir
				Categorization for a non-musician: Less than 2 years of musical
        training, currently not practicing at all, only listening to music	
	- Dependent Variable: Arrangement of Musical Stimuli in a Circle according to their
         similarity

3) What are your hypotheses?
- H0: There is no difference between musicians and non-musicians in their similarity rating
- H1: There is a difference between musicians and non-musicians in their similarity rating
- H2: There are bigger distances in the arrangement for musicians than for non-musicians

4) How many and which conditions will participants/ samples be assigned to?
- Between-subjects design
- no randomisation, blinding or counterbalancing

5) How many observations will be collected and what rule will you use to terminate data collection?
- 15 people per group will be measured
- data exclusion:
- power:
- effect size:
- if adopting Bayesian sampling methods: what is your prior?
- what is your criterion Bayes factor for asserting relative support of H0 or H1, or your maximum resource limit?

6) What are your study inclusion criteria?
Look at point 2

7) What are your data exclusion criteria?
- if participant wants to cancel the experiment before he finished with it

8) What positive controls or quality checks will confirm that the obtained results are able to provide a fair test of the stated hypothesis?
- was the independent variable, dependent variable or instrumentation used correctly?
- haben alle Musiker das gleiche formale Training erhalten? → wahrscheinlich nicht
- was genau wurde gelernt?
- welche Stücke wurden gespielt?
- wurde vom Blatt gespielt oder frei improvisiert?

9) Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/Hypothesis(es)
- H0:
- H1:
- H2:

- representational similarity analysis for creating the matrices
- pattern component modeling for evaluating the models and which model fits best

10) Are you proposing to collect new data or analyse existing data?
- new data
