# 04.06.2018 - 10.06.2018

## Monday
- set up experiment in psychopy (MPQ-R and STOMP)
- checked inverse multidimensional scaling with Peer --> is working
- checked MET with Peer --> is working , check again on Tuesday

## Tuesday
- office meeting
- talked with Peer, Mirjam and Marie about procedure of our behavioral experiment
- checked if everythings ready for the experiment
- created the psychopy experiment "music bekanntheit" where all stimuli from inverse multidimensional scaling are asked again to check if the participants knew them before
- tested first participant: everything worked out

## Wednesday
- had a look on the data with Peer in Matlab
- created sheet for the data of behavioral persons with all tests together

## Thursday
- corrected STOMP so that there is a "Vielen Dank fuer die Teilnahme!" in the end

## Friday
- talked with Marie together with professor about our ethics proposal
- set up STOMP on mac: is working now
- set up iMDS on mac: is working now
- set up MPQ-R on mac (corrected text height in chills): is working now

## Saturday
- tested 2 persons

# 11.06. - 24.06.2018

## Monday
- binding registration for bachelor thesis

holidays

# 25.06. - 30.06.2018

## Monday
- received a yes of 6 subjects for my experiment (I have recruited 3 until now)
- wrote e-mail for distributor of experimental subjects
- read e-mail of Malte for ethics proposal; did some comments in his document; sent that back to him
- gave registration document with signatures of supervisors of thesis back to examination office of psychology

## Tuesday
- office meeting: Marie has nearly recruited all participants; Mirjam as well
- send e-mail to disttributor of experimental subjects
- organized further acquisition of participants
- talked with Peer about analysis: want to transform matrix of the arrangement to a vector with "nilearn.connectome.sym_matrix_to_vec(symmetric, discard_diagonal=True)" for further computation
- by the help of sklearn.svm (support vector machines) we want to measure if the model of musicians can predict the assessed arrangement of the musicians and if the model of non-musicians can predict the assessed arrangement of non-musicians
- read about matrix to vector function and about prediction with sklearn svm

## Wednesday
- helped Marie with EEG experiment
- talked about the ethics proposal and the changes we want to make
- helped Rebeccas and Jan-Otto with experiment
- recruited one subject

## Thursday
- recruited 3 subjects
- talked with Marie about ethics proposal, sent that corrected version to Malte
