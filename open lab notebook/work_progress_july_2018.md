## Monday
- continued with introduction (pitch and pitch perception)
- checked the experiment on Mac for testing on Tuesday: everything is working
- sent new e-mail to subject distributor

## Tuesday
- office meeting
- recruited 3 persons
- found paper of Kohlrausch et al. for introduction "Perceptual evaluation of music similarity"

## Wednesday
- recruited 2 persons
- worked on introduction
- read paper of Kohlrausch et al. in depth

## Thursday
- recruited one person, one person cancelled appointment and asked for an appointment next week
- worked on introduction
- wrote points of Kohlrausch Paper down

## Friday
- recruited one person, one person cancelled appointment and asked for an appointment next week
- worked on introduction

# 09.07. - 13.07.2018

## Monday
- Peer explained the overall procedure in analysis of the behavioral data
- Marie created a google docs sheet for that
- converted files in matlab from 1x190 vectors into 20x20 matrices by the command 'behav_RDM_square=squareRDM(estimate_dissimMat_ltv)'
- created a structure for all files in matlab with columns 'RDM', 'name' and 'musician'
- computed average for musicians and non-musicians in Matlab (Matlab needs specific naming for 'nme' column
in name column there has to be 'subject' 
- average function is named 'averageRDMs_subjectSession.m'
TO DO: concatenate RDMs, create MDS of RDMs, create models of music features

## Tuesday
- recruited 2 subjects
- created conceptual models with Marie (allequal-model, allunequal-model, randomization-model, maingenre-model)

## Wednesday
- recruited 2 subjects

## Thursday
- converted matfiles into csv files
- created RDMs

# 16.07. - 22.07.2018

## Monday
- created conceptual models for musicians and non-musicians
- remade conceptual models (allUnequal, allEqual, mainGenres & randomization) so that they are available in csv format
- visualized them in jupyter notebook --> good cmap to visualize: Spectral_r
- failed at creating MDS plots because there is no input in concatenating function (after concatenating there is no data in "asdfasdfadsf.pkl")
- uploaded all conceptual models in Google Drive
- uploaded all RDMs of musicians and non-musicians in Google Drive
